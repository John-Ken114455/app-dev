# ** Avatar: The Last Airbender **

also known as ==Avatar: The Legend of Aang== in some regions, is an American animated fantasy action television series created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio.

Avatar is set in a largely *Asian-inspired world* in which some people can telekinetically manipulate one of the four **elements—water, earth, fire or air**—through practices known as "bending", inspired by Chinese martial arts. The only individual who can bend all four elements, the "Avatar", is responsible for maintaining harmony among the world's four nations, and serves as the link between the physical world and the spirit world. The series follows the journey of ==twelve-year-old Aang==, the current Avatar and last survivor of his nation, the Air Nomads, along with his friends ==Katara, Sokka, and Toph,== as they strive to end the Fire Nation's war against the other nations and defeat ==Fire Lord Ozai== before he conquers the world. The series also follows ==Zuko==, the exiled prince of the Fire Nation, seeking to restore his lost honor by capturing Aang, accompanied by his uncle Iroh—and later, his sister Azula. Avatar is presented in a style that combines anime with American cartoons and relies on the imagery of primarily Chinese culture, with various other influences from different East Asian, Southeast Asian, South Asian, North Asian, and Native American cultures.
